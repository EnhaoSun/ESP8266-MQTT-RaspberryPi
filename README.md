# ESP8266-MQTT-RaspberryPi
Use ESP8266MOD AI-THINKER as client sending data collected by DHT22 sensor to Raspberry pi.

P.S: I did this project in 2017 summer. The code was almost lost now. If I have time, I will do it again and try to upload it.

To do this you will need:
* Raspberry Pi desktop setup
* One DHT22 sensor
* Some jumper
* Breadboard
